            My journey into programming started with curiosity — I wanted to
            understand how websites actually work behind the scenes. What began
            as simple HTML and CSS experiments quickly grew into a passion for
            building interactive user interfaces using JavaScript and React.

            I enjoy working on frontend projects where design meets logic.
            Transforming UI designs into responsive, smooth, and accessible
            experiences is the part I love most. I care deeply about clean code,
            reusable components, and small details that make a big difference
            in user experience.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed max-w-xl">
            Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring creative activities like
            sketching UI ideas, reading tech blogs, and spending time on
            hobbies that help me reset — whether that’s listening to music,
            watching documentaries, or light outdoor activities. These moments
            help me stay inspired and focused.
